Your submission will run against only preliminary test cases. Full test cases will run at the end of the day.
Jonathan is in a science class, but because he does not understand how to name acids, he would like you to make a program for him. There are two types of acids at his level,  and .

Conditions for naming an acid:

If the given input starts with hydro and ends with ic then it is a non-metal acid.
If the input only ends with ic then it is a polyatomic acid.
If it does not have either case, then output not an acid.
For example, for the input, , the correct output is -  as the input begins with hydro and ends withic.

Complete the function acidNaming which takes a string input with the name of the acid, and return a string describing the appropriate type of acid.

Input Format

The first line will contain an integer . 
The next  lines will contain a single word .

Constraints

Word  is made up of lower-case english letters.
 Length of 
Output Format

If the word starts with hydro and ends with ic then it is a non-metal acid. Hence, the correct output is - .

If the word only ends with ic then it is a  . Hence, the correct output is  .

If the word does not meet any of the cases, then the correct output is   .

Explanation 0

In the first case, the input begins with hydro and ends with ic, hence, the correct output is - . 
In the second case, the input only ends with ic, hence, the correct output is  . 
The third case, the input neither begins with hydro nor ends with ic, hence the correct output is   .
