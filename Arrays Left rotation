Arrays: Left Rotation

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of integers) and d (the number of left rotations you must perform). 
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state.


Sample Input

5 4
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

5 1 2 3 4
Explanation

When we perform  left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:

Thus, we print the array's final state as a single line of space-separated values, which is 5 1 2 3 4.
